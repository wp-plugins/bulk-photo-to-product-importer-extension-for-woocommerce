### Back End Features ###
* **Bulk Import Photos** - Which are, then, automatically converted into WooCommerce Products. Product Titles are automatically generated based on the file name of the photo(s) being imported. You have the option to modify these titles during and after the upload process.
* **Event Types and Events** - So you can easily locate that photo shoot you did for that local high school, sporting event, etc... by creating an Event Type (Ex. Sports, Portraits, etc...) and a specific Event (Ex. Jane and John Doe Wedding, Portland High School Portraits)
* **BPTPI Variations** - Many photographers don't just sell the individual photos, rather, they sell what the photo is printed on (photo prints, smartphone cases, shirts, posters, etc...). Using Variations: administrators can create unlimited custom Variations and associate a price with that specific Variation.
* **Downloadable Photos** - Simply create a BPTPI Variation named "Downloadable" and viola! Any users who purchase that Variation will be able to download the photo upon purchasing!
* **Private Events and Photos** - We understand that sometimes photos need to be kept private. That's why you can give Users access to specific Events, preventing all other Users from being able to view the photos within that event or assign a generic password to that event for anyone to use to view them. [(Available in paid version only)](http://www.theportlandcompany.com/shop/custom-web-applications/photo-to-product-importer-wordpress-plugin-for-woocommerce/)
* **Widgets** - We've also created an advanced Search by Event or Search by Date WordPress Widget. [(Available in paid version only)](http://www.theportlandcompany.com/shop/custom-web-applications/photo-to-product-importer-wordpress-plugin-for-woocommerce/)
* **Custom Watermark** - You can upload your own custom image that is dynamically embedded onto your images as a watermark prior to purchase. [(Available in paid version only)](http://www.theportlandcompany.com/shop/custom-web-applications/photo-to-product-importer-wordpress-plugin-for-woocommerce/)

### Front End Features ###
* **Browse and Search by Event** - If the Event is Private users Events simply won't appear in search results unless the user has been authenticated. [(Available in paid version only)](http://www.theportlandcompany.com/shop/custom-web-applications/photo-to-product-importer-wordpress-plugin-for-woocommerce/)
* **Search by Event Date** - If the Event doesn't have a specific name, or the user can't remember it, they may search by the Event's date. [(Available in paid version only)](http://www.theportlandcompany.com/shop/custom-web-applications/photo-to-product-importer-wordpress-plugin-for-woocommerce/)
